# Zomaggy - Food Delivery System

Zomaggy is a full-stack food delivery system built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack. With Zomaggy, users can conveniently order food online from a wide range of restaurants. This project aims to provide a seamless and user-friendly experience for ordering food.

## Getting Started

To run the Zomaggy project locally, you'll need to set up both the frontend and backend parts of the application. Here are the steps to get started:

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following software and tools installed:

- [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/): You need Node.js to run the project.
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/): You should have MongoDB installed and running for the backend.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/): You need Git for cloning the project repository.

### Backend Setup

1. Clone the Zomaggy repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/zomaggy.git
   cd zomaggy
   ```

2. Navigate to the backend directory:

   ```
   cd backend
   ```

3. Install backend dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. Set up environment variables:

   Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and configure necessary environment variables such as the database connection URL, JWT secret, etc.

5. Start the backend server:

   ```
   npm start
   ```

### Frontend Setup

6. Navigate to the frontend directory:

   ```
   cd ../frontend
   ```

7. Install frontend dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

8. Start the frontend development server:

   ```
   npm start
   ```

Now, you can access the Zomaggy application in your web browser by navigating to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (or the specified frontend port).

Feel free to explore the project, order food, and enjoy the experience!
